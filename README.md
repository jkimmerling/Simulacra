# SimulacrIoT
HVAC and IoT Device Simulator

This is meant to act as a simulator of a device/network of devices. Its primary uses cases are to test  
either data pipelines or fault detection algorithms.

# Work in progress  
Currently just a basic Flask Api interface  
Coming next:  
MQTT & Bacnet interfaces
